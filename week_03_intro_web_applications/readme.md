#Week 3 - Node
This week we'll be working with Node, Express, Postgres. For interfacing with postgres we'll be using Sequelize

##Tools
We'll be using the following technologies this week. Feel free to read some of the intro materials on each site, specifically Node and Express.


* [Node.js Homepage](http://nodejs.org/) - Used for building network applications.
* [Express Framework](http://expressjs.com/) - Used for building web apps
* [Postgres](http://postgresapp.com/) - The database we'll be using
* [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/) - The npm package that we will use to interface postgres and node together

##Optional Readings
I haven't personally used all these, but some of these resources looks good.

Don't get too caught up on syntax, the following links talk about how things conceptually work. There can be slight syntax difference between different databases(mySQL, sqlite3, postgres, etc..)
