# Apartment lab

- Create a database called apartmentlab 
- Using this database, create two tables, one for owners and one for properties
- Keep this relationship in mind when designing your schema:
	+ **One owner can have many properties**

###Tables

- The owners table should consist of: 
	+ owner_id (this should be the primary key as well as a unique number that increments automatically)
	+ name
	+ age
- The properties table should consist of:
	+ property_id (this should be the primary key as well as a unique number that increments automatically)
	+ name
	+ number of units
	+ owner_id 
		+ There should also be a foreign key that references the owners table
