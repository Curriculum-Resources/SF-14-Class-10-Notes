## Review Questions


### Problems

Get comfortable with implementing the following:

### Data Structures Coming Up 

Study up on the following:
[helpful resource](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/visualization/index.html)

* Doubly Linked List (Monday Morning)
	* [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list)

* Does the DS preserve ordering?
* What is the lookup time?


### Not Covered Data Structures

Going forward from WDI you should research the following:

* Sets
* Other Trees
	* B-Tree (just concepts and use cases)
* Hashes (not to be confused with Hashing Functions)
	* Hash Table (uses and implementation)
* Graphs
	* Directed Graph
	* Graph

### Words For Thought

The following is a list of words and topics to review more or less through scrambling Wikipedia, Rails Guides, and class notes. It is recommended you review the list for **familiar topics and words** first before looking for new ones. Some **new words** are being introduced below, so don't freak out. You will have time to think about all of them.

#### Recommendation

Do this vocab building in a group of 3 to 4, but still look it over independently.
