# WDI JULY NOTES
## Distributed Lesson Materials



### Contributing 

    For each lesson the notes (if any) will be added to a `weekly_folder` in the repo in a subfolder related to that day's lesson materials under `dawn` or `dusk` , e.g. a lesson on `Monday` in `week 2` in the `morning` on  **intro to css** would go in a `02` folder for `Week 2` as `02/day_1/dawn` with a markdown file containing relevant notes, `02/day_1/dawn/intro_css.md`. Each lesson added to the repo should update the `ReadMe` topical index, e.g. using the lesson above one would find the most relevant  **Topical Bullet** and add a sub-bullet for the new `sub-topic`.

`Sample Structure`

```
00/
  day_1/
    dawn/
      intro_terminal/
        ReadMe.md
      intro_git/
        git_stuff.png
        ReadMe.md
    dusk/
      intro_js/
        cool_img.png
        ReadMe.md
  day_2/
    dawn/
      ...
    dusk/
      ...
  ...
01/
  day_1/
    ...
  day_2/
    ...
  ...
...

```


    Links in the **Topical Index** are relative to the repo, so if one were to add `intro_git` as a link under the `prep_work` bullet it would be added as follows:

```
* prep_work
  * [intro_git](/00/day_1/dawn/intro_git)
```

###  Topical Index

* prep_work
  * [intro_git](/00/day_1/dawn/intro_git)
