### Contributing 

Below is an outline of how to add notes to this repository, navigate and develop the folder structure, as well as notes on maintaining the *Topical Index* above.

#### Adding notes

For each lesson the notes (if any) will be added to a `weekly_folder` in the repo in a subfolder related to that day's lesson materials separated into `dawn` or `dusk` day times. 

A lesson on `Monday` in `week 2` in the `morning` on  **intro to css** would go in a `week_02_web_fundamentals` folder for `Week 2` under something like the following:

```
week_02_web_fundamentals/
	day_1_intro_js_css/
		dawn_intro_css/
			...
```

Each `dawn` or `dusk` folder should have a markdown file containing relevant notes, 

```
week_02/
	day_1_intro_js_css/
		dawn_intro_css/
			ReadMe.md

``` 
The **main** lesson notes should be added to the repo as a `ReadMe` **markdown** file, so GitHub can render something for that folder.

#### IMPORTANT NOTE

>Each lesson added to the repo should update the `ReadMe` topical index, e.g. using the lesson above one would find the most relevant  **Topical Bullet** and add a sub-bullet for the new `sub-topic`.

=====

#### Folder Prefix and Suffix Explanation

Each folder in the repo has a *naming convention* involving a *date or time **prefix*** and a *theme_of_the_datetime **suffix***,

```
 time_or_date_prefix + the_overall_theme
```

For a **week** we might have the following:

* Week 1 has a `week_1` **prefix** plus its *weekly theme* `programming_and_web_fundamentals` **suffix**.

  ```
  Week 1 => week_1_programming_and_web_fundamentals
  ```
* Day 1 in Week 1 would also have a suffix theme, e.g. *a concatenation of the lesson topics from the day at the very least.*

  ```
  day_1_intro_js_css/
  ```
* Dawn in Day 1 above would just have suffix that *is the **topic of the lesson***.

  ```
  dawn_intro_css/
  ```

```

#### Topical Index
Links in the **Topical Index** are relative to the repo, so if one were to add `intro_git` as a link under the `prep_work` bullet it would be added as follows:

```
* prep_work
  * [intro_git](/00/day_1/dawn/intro_git)
```

If you're working on material you don't want commited then add the `working` prefix.
