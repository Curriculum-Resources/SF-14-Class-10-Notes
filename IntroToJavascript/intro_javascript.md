## Why Javascript? 
![Javascript All The Things](javascript.jpg "Javascript")

* Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.  

Simple answer: We want high performance web sites!

*But what does this mean?*

- Javascript is the language that interacts with the DOM, a.k.a the browser.  
- We must use Javascript for any code we want to execute on the client side.  
- Sometimes executing code on the client side is faster.  
* Client side programming:
  * Interaction with the DOM
  * Respond to DOM events: click, submit...
  * Send requests to the server.
  * Acts on response from the server.
