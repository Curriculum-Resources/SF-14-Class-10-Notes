DoublyLinkedListLab
===================

A lab to implement a doubly linked list in ruby.  Use the specs for node and list to implement a doubly linked list.

__FIRST__: Work on the node class and get the specs passing.

__SECOND__: For the list implementation, the methods should have a similar interface to ruby array.  Here are the first methods you should implement:

* new (initialize)
* push
* pop
* length

__THIRD__: work on these methods:

* []
* []=
* first
* last
* shift
* unshift
* insert
* delete_at

__LASTLY__: if you have time, implement the following methods:

* reverse
* max
* min
* reduce
* each
* flatten


__HINT__: USE THE SPECS!!  The specs will help you a lot.  Make sure to run them and get them to pass for the first set of methods before you move on to the 2nd or 3rd set of methods.
