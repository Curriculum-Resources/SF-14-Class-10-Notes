# Models and Validation

## Objectives

* Convert our knowledge of Sequelize models into knowledge of Rails models.
* Use Rails to generate models & migrations for us.
* Get comfortable with `rails console`.
* Add validations to our models.

## Definitions

### Active Record

The ORM implementation that comes with Rails. Makes our objects
intelligent without using SQL.

Active Record was described by Martin Fowler in his book Patterns of
Enterprise Application Architecture. It is an implementation of the
Active Record pattern which itself is a description of an Object
Relational Mapping (ORM) system. [Additional reading](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)

### Rake

Rake is a simple ruby helper program. It helps us to perform tasks by
running scripts. A typical rake command works like rake and then a
space, followed by whatever task we'd like it to perform. We can also
write our own tasks and if we did, those would go inside the lib tasks
folder. We can see which tasks are available, both the Rails default
tasks and any custom tasks from the command line.

In terminal you can type type `rake -T`. That's going to return a list
of the tasks that we have available. It returns a long list of all the
tasks. Notice in particular, that some of these tasks have db in front
of them. There's quite a few of them that are used for working with
the database. If we want to see just those listings, you can amend
your last command so that it's `rake -T db`.  [Additional Reading](https://rubygems.org/gems/rake)

### YAML

.yml - YAML, YAML Ain't Markup Language (recursive definition and a
joke)

## Creating a model

`rails generate model CamelCaseName`

- Creates a model_name.rb file.
- This also creates a migration file.
- In our model we specify our validations and relationships.
- File names, class names and table names really matter!

## In-class Exercise

Generate a new Rails project. Set it up to use Postgres as our
database (-d).  We're also excluding tests for now (-T) since we will
be using a different testing package (RSpec) in the future.

`rails new models_example -T -d postgresql`

Create our database.

`rake db:create`

Create a new model called User with first_name and last_name
properties that are strings.

`rails generate model User first_name:string last_name:string`

Migrate our database to create the `users` table.

`rake db:migrate`

## Rails Console

To enter, go to terminal and in the root of your rails app type

`rails console`

or

`rails c`

This is IRB with your rails app loaded in.

## In-class Exercise (continued)

Inside of your Rails console:

Create a new User object.

`irb(main):001:0> me = User.new`

Set the name of the user.

```
irb(main):002:0> me.first_name = "Tim"
irb(main):002:0> me.last_name = "Licata"
```

Save your user to the database.

`irb(main):003:0> me.save`

Retrieve all of the users in the database.

`irb(main):004:0> User.all`

## More on Generating Models

When you generate a model in rails it will generate a matching migration

`rails generate model MODEL_NAME column_name:data_type`

In our migration we use a code block to add columns
`t.column "first_name", :string, :limit => 50`
or
`t.string "first_name", :limit => 50`

Table column types

```
binary
boolean
date
datetime
decimal
float
integer
string
text
time
```

Table column options

```
:limit => size
:default => value
:null => true/false
:precision => number
```

Also note that Rails automatically adds an ID column

## Migrations

Once you create a database and configure your Rails project to connect
to it, you need to add tables. One way to do this is by writing Rails
migrations. A migration is a set of database instructions. Those
instructions are Ruby code, which migrates our database from one state
to another. Essentially they describe database changes. In our
migration we can create a table, add a column, change the name of a
column, drop a table and much more. A migration will contain both the
instructions for moving up to a new state, and also instructions for
moving back down to the previous state.


If a migration has instructions to create a table when moving forward
or up, it will also include the instructions to allow it to move back
down by dropping the table. If you move up by adding three columns to
the table then you'll also have instructions to move back down by
removing those three columns. Being able to move in both the
directions like this allows us to migrate in both directions. We can
migrate our database to the newest version or migrate back to a
previous version. Why use migrations? Migrations maintain our database
schema with our application code.

## Generating migrations

These reside in our db directory and to create one we use

```rails generate migration MIGRATION_NAME```

## Running migrations

``` rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=_____``` (by default it is development)

Rails will run all migrations that have not been run with rake db migrate

To go back use

`rake db:rollback` 

To get the ID for jumping back and forth use 

```rake db:migrate:status```

Then
```rake db:migrate VERSION=ID```

Or
```rake db:migrate:up VERSION=X```
```rake db:migrate:down VERSION=X```
up 

## Migration methods

```
drop_table(table)
rename_table(table, new_name)
add_column(table, column, type, options)
remove_column(table, column)
rename_column(table, column, new_name)
change_column(table, column, type, options)
add_index(table, column, options)
execute("any SQL string") - rare
```

What does `change` do? It knows how to go up and down
Sometimes you can not reverse things with change like when you remove
a column

## In-class Migration Example

Let's store user's ages along with their names. Generate a new
migration file with name AddAgeToUsers.

`rails generate migration AddAgeToUsers`

Open newly created migration file and modify the `change` method.

```
  def change
    add_column :users, :age, :integer
  end
```

Run the migration so that the column is added to the table.

`rake db:migrate`

We can check that the migration ran successfully.

`rake db:migrate:status`

We can also undo the migration if we didn't like it. (Not necessary
now, but good to know.  If you do this, you can simple re-run the
migration with db:migrate).

`rake db:rollback`

## CRUD in Rails Console

#### Creating

2 Different ways

##### New/save

1. Instaniate an object
2. Set values 
3. Save

- user = User.new
- user.new_record? returns true or false if it exists in the DB
- user.first_name = "Elie"
- user.first_name -> returns "Elie"
- user = User.new(:first_name => "Elie", :last_name => "Schoppik")
- user.save -> saves to the DB
- user.id -> 1


##### Create

1. Do all in 1 step

- user = User.create(:first_name => "Elie", :last_name => "Schoppik") 

#### Updating

2 Different ways

Find/save

1. Find - user = User.find(1)
2. Set - user.first_name = "Taco"
3. Save - user.save

Update

1. user = User.find(1)
2. user.update_attributes(:first_name => "taco")

#### Delete

Find/destroy

1. Find - user = User.find(1)
2. Destroy (not delete, delete bypasses some rails features stick with destroy)- user.destroy

You still have this when it's deleted you just can't change anything

#### Finding

1. Primary key finder (use when it's expected to exist)
 - User.find(number)
2. Dynamic Finder
	- User.find_by_id(number) -> returns nil instead of error
	- User.find_by_first_name(string) -> returns nil instead of error
3. User.all -> returns an array of objects
4. User.first -> finds first
5. User.last -> finds last

#### Query methods - conditions

Search using conditionals:

Where(conditions):

- User.where(:first_name => "Elie")

this returns an ActiveRelation object and can also be chained

- can pass in a hash, string or array
  - User.where("first_name" => "Elie")
  - User.where("first_name = ?", "Elie")
     - SQL injection safe
- use .first to get the object instead of array

#### Query methods - order, limit and offset

- order (table_name.column_name ASC/DESC)
  - User.order(:age)
  - User.order("age")
  - User.order(age: :asc)
  - User.order(age: :desc)
- limit (integer)
  - User.limit(1)
- offset (integer)
  - User.offset(5)

these can be chained together

## Validations

#### Validation methods

for all of these validations you can pass in an error message of - :message => "Something error related" 

- validates_presence_of - attribute must not be blank
- validates_length_of - must have a length of x. Pass in a hash with (:is, :minimum, :maximum, etc.) 
- validates_numericality_of - attribute must be an integer or float (can pass in :equal_to)
- validates_inclusion_of - attribute must be in a list of choices 
- validates_exclusion_of - attribute must be in a list of choices 
- validates_format_of - attribute must match a regular expression (pass in :with)
- validates_uniqueness_of - attribute must be unique
- validates_acceptance_of - makes sure an attribute is accepted (a TOS is agreed)
- validates_confirmation_of - attribute must be confirmed (type in password twice). Rails will only run this if the attribute is set to something
- validates_associated - validates associated objects (validate options in associated relationships)

- can pass in (:on => :save/:create/:update) to specify when to validate
- can also pass in :if => :method / :unless => :method to help with determining when to validate (only check email if user wants to be identified by email)

#### Using validation methods

- Before you even start - think and ask yourself what should I validate?
- Add the validations after your associations in the model
- in rails console you can run s.valid? to see if it's valid and then s.errors to see what's wrong if there is a problem.

#### Validates Method

- shortcut for validations 
- wrap these all up in a hash

```
validates :COL_NAME, :presence => true, 
										:length => {:maximum => 50}, 
										:numericality => false, 
										:uniqueness => true
```

#### In-class Validation Example

We set our validations in our app/models/user.rb model.

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :first_name
  validates_presence_of :last_name
end
```

or

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :first_name, presence: true
  validates :last_name, presence: true
end
```

#### Custom validations
```
validate :custom_method

def custom_method
	# some validation goes here
end
```

example: 

```
FORBIDDEN_USERNAMES = ["taco", "Elie"]
validate :username_is_allowed

def username_is_allowed
	if FORBIDDEN_USERNAMES.include?(username)
		errors.add(:username, "this is a restricted username")
	end
end
```
